## Optimizations

I review my CodeWars solutions on a regular basis as I consider this a chance to refactor my code, improve its efficiency, and enhance its readability.

## Lessons Learned:

There's always room for progress and improvement. There are many ways to solve one kata, with more or less lines of code. Consistently stretching my brain to find a solution is invaluable and comes a long way.
